Dig Deep, baby.
===============

This is just here for posterity, because why not.

This is an old project I created as a proof of concept - basically, to see what I could do with AngularJS. I decided to try making a copy of Cookie Clicker, not intending to ever balance the numbers or game mechanics. I just wanted to see if I could implement the logic, and maybe get some type of graphics system working.
